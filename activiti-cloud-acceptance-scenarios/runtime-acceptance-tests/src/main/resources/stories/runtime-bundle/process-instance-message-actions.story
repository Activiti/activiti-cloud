Narrative:
As a user
I want to perform operations on process instance having message events

Scenario: deliver messages via process runtime Rest Api
Given messages: session timeout of 5 seconds
And the user is authenticated as hruser
And messages: generated unique sessionVariable called businessId
When messages: the user sends a start message named startMessage with businessKey value of businessId session variable
Then messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'startMessage'
And messages: MESSAGE_WAITING event is emitted for the message 'boundaryMessage'
And messages: the user sends a message named boundaryMessage with correlationKey value of businessId session variable
And messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'boundaryMessage'
And messages: MESSAGE_WAITING event is emitted for the message 'catchMessage'
And messages: the user sends a message named catchMessage with correlationKey value of businessId session variable
And messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'catchMessage'
And messages: MESSAGE_SENT event is emitted for the message 'endMessage'
And messages: the process with message events is completed

Scenario: start process with non existing correlation key
Given messages: session timeout of 5 seconds
And the user is authenticated as hruser
And messages: generated unique sessionVariable called businessId
When messages: the user sends a start message named startMessage with businessKey value of businessId session variable
Then messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'startMessage'
And messages: MESSAGE_WAITING event is emitted for the message 'boundaryMessage'
And messages: the user gets not found error when sends a message named boundaryMessage with nonexisting correlationKey

Scenario: start process with duplicate correlation key
Given messages: session timeout of 5 seconds
And the user is authenticated as hruser
And messages: generated unique sessionVariable called businessId
When messages: the user sends a start message named startMessage with businessKey value of businessId session variable
Then messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'startMessage'
And messages: MESSAGE_WAITING event is emitted for the message 'boundaryMessage'
And messages: the user gets internal server error when starting a process with message named startMessage and duplicate correlationKey businessId

Scenario: execute processes using cloud native message events with businessKey correlation
Given messages: session timeout of 5 seconds
And the user is authenticated as hruser
And messages: generated unique sessionVariable called businessId
When messages: the user sends a start message named StartCloudMessage1 with businessKey value of businessId session variable
Then messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'StartCloudMessage1'
And messages: MESSAGE_SENT event is emitted for the message 'StartCloudMessage3'
And messages: MESSAGE_SENT event is emitted for the message 'StartCloudMessage2'
And messages: the process with definition key of 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process1' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable has status 'COMPLETED'
And messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'StartCloudMessage3' for process definition key 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process3' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable
And messages: MESSAGE_SENT event is emitted for the message 'IntermediateCloudMessage2' for process definition key 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process3' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable
And messages: MESSAGE_WAITING event is emitted for the message 'IntermediateCloudMessage3' for process definition key 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process3' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable
And messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'StartCloudMessage2' for process definition key 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process2' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable
And messages: MESSAGE_WAITING event is emitted for the message 'IntermediateCloudMessage2' for process definition key 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process2' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable
And messages: MESSAGE_SENT event is emitted for the message 'IntermediateCloudMessage3' for process definition key 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process2' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable
And messages: MESSAGE_RECEIVED event is emitted for the message 'IntermediateCloudMessage3' for process definition key 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process3' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable
And messages: the process with definition key of 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process2' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable has status 'COMPLETED'
And messages: the process with definition key of 'ThrowCatchMessageIT_Process3' having businessKey value of 'businessId' session variable has status 'COMPLETED'
